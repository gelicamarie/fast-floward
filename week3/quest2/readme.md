- `W3Q2` â€“ Composability <3 Access Control

In this quest, we will be using what we learned today to modify our RegistryNFTContract. In its current implementation, you must pass in a reference to a Tenant itself (with no restrictive interfaces) to the `mintNFT` function so it can update the `Tenant` resource's `totalSupply` in the `init` function of the `NFT` resource. I want you to change this. Try and figure out a way (very similar to above) where we can define an interface that exposes a function to update `totalSupply` so we can restrict the reference we pass into `mintNFT` a little more. Once you do this, make sure you update the transactions involved in this process of minting/linking the `Tenant` resource to the public to include this resource interface.
