For this quest, inside `packages/dapplib/tests/fast_floward-tests.js`, there are 2 tests for you to write. Follow the guide above on how to write tests (and use the other tests in the file as hints) to try and figure out how to set up the tests I have described for you. There are a bunch of comments above each of the two tests to try and help you in your implementation.
