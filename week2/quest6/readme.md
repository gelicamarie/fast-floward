- `W2Q6` â€“ The Client

In `packages/client/src/harness/fast_floward-harness.js`, search for 3 action cards that have "TODO" above them. You will have to implement these 3 action cards. I have already implemented the DappLib functions, transactions, and scripts for you, so all you have to do is the action card step. When making your action cards, make sure you are passing in all the correct fields that your DappLib function needs using **widgets**.
