- `W2Q4` – And Withdraw Too?!?!?

You'll notice that the `withdraw` function in the `Vault` resource is gone as well! Gosh, whoever removed these functions must be an idiot...

Anyways, do the same thing as W2Q3. Implement the `withdraw` function by following the comments and hints I left for you. Then, go to the UI Harness, and see if the **action card** that says, "DAY 2: Kibble - Transfer Tokens" works. You can check to see if it works with the "DAY 1: Kibble - Get Balance" **action card** to see if Kibble was transferred from one account to another.
